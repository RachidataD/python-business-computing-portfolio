# Python Business Computing Portfolio

Four mini-projects that demonstrate core data skills:

1. **Descriptive stats & correlation** (cars dataset)
2. **Text analytics** (word counts + categories)
3. **Salary vs Unemployment** (scatter + grouped bars)
4. **Simple relational DB** (branches/teams schema + lookups)

## How to run
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open notebooks (start with `notebooks/problem_1_stats.ipynb`) and run all cells.

## Repo map
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks per problem  
- `data/` — small CSVs for demos  
- `images/` — any charts you want to save (optional)

## Notes
- Data files here are small public/synthetic samples so the notebooks run quickly.
